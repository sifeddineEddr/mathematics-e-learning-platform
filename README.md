# üìã Repository Use Requirements

1. Clone the repository on your local machine.
    
    ```php
    git clone https://github.com/sifeddineEddr/mathematics-e-learning-platform.git
    ```
    
2. Navigate into the local repository, and run the following commands to install the dependencies and set up the project.
    1. Laravel Project
        1. Add composer
            
            ```php
            cd mathematics-e-learning-platform/teacher-platform
            composer install
            ```
            
        2. Set up the environment variables and generate the encryption key
            
            ```php
            cp .env.example .env
            php artisan key:generate
            ```
            
        3. Install the app's layout dependencies and their build
            
            ```php
            npm install
            npm run build
            ```
            
        4. Configure your **`tailwind.config.js`** file
            
            ```jsx
            /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
            module.exports = {
                content: [
                    "./vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Pagination/resources/views/*.blade.php",
                    "./vendor/laravel/jetstream/**/*.blade.php",
                    "./storage/framework/views/*.php",
                    "./resources/views/**/*.blade.php",
                    "./node_modules/flowbite/**/*.js",
                ],
            
                theme: {
                    extend: {
                        fontFamily: {
                            sans: ["Figtree", ...defaultTheme.fontFamily.sans],
                        },
                        colors: {
                            "brand-red": "#C00005",

                    require("@tailwindcss/forms"),
                    require("@tailwindcss/typography"),
                    require("flowbite/plugin"),
                ],
            };
            ```
            
        5. Configure your `resources/js/app**.js`** file
            
            ```jsx
            import './bootstrap';
            
            import Alpine from 'alpinejs';
            import focus from '@alpinejs/focus';
            import 'flowbite';
            window.Alpine = Alpine;
            
            Alpine.plugin(focus);
            
            Alpine.start();
            ```
            
        6. Create the database tables
